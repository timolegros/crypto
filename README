Quadkoin is not optimized for speed but its structure is extremely readable. For example, transactions, networks, mempools are all objects which can be manipulated.
The alternative is to keep all of the information in these components in json which would improve speed but reduces readability. The object method is mainly slower because
it requires iterating through lists of objects when converting to json since objects are not serializable themselves. This coin is meant to be used to learn the integral
components of cryptocurrencies.
