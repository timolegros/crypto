Quadkoin is not optimized for speed but its structure is extremely modular. For example, transactions, networks, mempools are all objects which can be manipulated.
The alternative is to keep all of the information in these components in json which would improve speed but reduces modularity. The object method is mainly slower because
it requires iterating through lists of objects when converting to json since objects are not serializable themselves. This coin is meant to be used to expirment with various
cryptocurrency features. The object oriented nature of this cryptocurrency makes it very easy to add new functionality.
